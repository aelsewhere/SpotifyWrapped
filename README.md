# SpotifyWrapped


## Getting Started
_**Before exploring**_: look at secret.py. This file is necessary for using the rest of these spotify wrapped features. You will need to get your *own* CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REDIRECT_URI. You can get your info on [Spotify's Site for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/). For more info on getting an access token, look [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started#request-an-access-token).
